# Algorithms
A collection of common algorithms.

# Description
This repository contains a set of useful algorithms and data structures that are essential in the understanding
of computer science. Accompanied with this repository is a list of tutorials on my website. Each algorithm, or
data structure will be paired with JUnit tests that can be used to further understand and verify the classes.

# Structure
Each package in the main directory has a corresponding test directory. Currently the following topics are included:

Sorters - Various sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort
